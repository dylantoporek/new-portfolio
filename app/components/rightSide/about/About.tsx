                I was born and raised in the Upper West Side of New York City. For my undergraduate studies, I attended UMass Amherst and graduated with a major in economics and a minor in philosophy. After graduation, I taught math to middle and high school students for a while before transitioning to software engineering.

                My interest in software engineering has always been there. Only recently, however, have I been able to pursue that interest. Flatiron School's software engineering program gave me the foundation I needed to begin my journey as a developer. During the course, I found satisfaction in learning how to build webpages from scratch, systematically resolving errors in my code, and being able utilize all aspects of creativity to shape my personal projects.

                Outside of work-related activities, my hobbies include playing games, cooking, hiking, and spending time with my dogs, Lily and Oaki.
